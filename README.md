# Reflections

After practicing with easier Landing page layout I decided to try to implement a more complex one combining all the knowledge in HTML/CSS I have gained so far along with some JavaScript and DOM manipulations in order to make the page more interactive.

Were used library AOS for smooth and effective animations and also internationalization, so the user can use the site in two languages - Ukrainian and English.

The main challenge of this project was to implement more difficult Design then I did before and to make it responsive. I had to use more advanced CSS features like flexbox, grid, media queries, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements along with Sass (SCSS) features.
